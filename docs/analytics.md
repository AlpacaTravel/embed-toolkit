# Analytics

## API Listeners

You can register your own event listeners to the [view](view) and use those to
track/fire your own engagement with the content.

You can do this to add your own specific interaction tracking, such as tracking;

 * Users indicating with features
 * Users clicking on features
 * etc.

These allow you to setup your own analytics packages, such as configuring your
own events in Google Analytics.

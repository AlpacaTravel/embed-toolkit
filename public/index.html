              <h2>Prague: From Castles to Cash Only</h2>
              <h3><span class="garamond">A city of rich history, with great respect for its past, Prague is also impressively progressive. There's a stellar food and drink scene that keeps on evolving, and a cosmopolitan local community who are warm and welcoming towards the city's visitors.</span></h3>
              <h3><span class="garamond">Take this walking tour of Prague to get a taste for what the city has to offer.</span></h3>
              <h2>Itinerary</h2>
              <h4>1. Start at the Old Town Square</h4>
              <p>Start your day here, in the beating heart of Prague.</p>
              <p>Prague's Old Town Square is a beautifully preserved part of the city, and a popular meeting place for tourists and locals. It's the gateway to Old Town, which snakes itself in all directions down the narrow streets off the square.</p>
              <p>Make sure you stop past the Old Town Hall to see thePrague Orloj,&nbsp;a medieval <a href="#astronomical">astronomical clock</a> that is the only one of its kind in the world still in operation.</p>
              <p>The square is also a memorial to various martyrs &ndash; try to spot the 27 crosses set into the pavement, which were laid after WWII to commemorate the execution of 27 Czech Protestant leaders in 1621.</p>
              <p>If you happen to be in town around Christmas, visit the Old Town Square to experience the impressive Prague Christmas Markets.&nbsp;</p>
              <a id="astronomical"></a>
              <h3>Astronomical Clock</h3>
              <p>Built in 1410 by a local clockmaker, the Prague Orloj is the oldest working clock of its kind in the world.</p>
              <p>The astronomical dial, shows the position of the Sun and Moon in the sky, while a calendar dial features a series of medallions representing the months of the year.</p>
              <p>Either side of the clock is flanked by representations of various Catholic saints, which come to life in a moving show every hour.</p>
              <p>Keep your eye out for Death, here depicted as a skeleton, who is given the task of striking the time.</p>
              <p>There is a local legend that says Prague will suffer if the clock is neglected, hence the city's dedication to its care and upkeep.</p>
              <h3>Havelsk&eacute; Trži&scaron;tě Market</h3>
              <p>You can't leave Prague without trying a <em>trdelnik</em>.</p>
              <p>Wander through the stalls at Havelsk&eacute; Trži&scaron;tě Market, selling everything from fruits and vegetables, to fresh flowers and handmade gifts and souvenirs.</p>
              <p>Whatever you do, make sure you pick up a <em>trdelnik</em> for the walk ahead &ndash; delicious sweet dough cooked on a spit and dusted with sugar. Get yours stuffed with Nutella for a breakfast of champions.</p>
              <hr />
              <h4>2.&nbsp;Beers and city views from the Prague Metronome</h4>
              <p>Unveiled in 1991, the metronome replaced an imposing statue of Stalin that had been destroyed 30 years earlier.</p>
              <p>Designed by international artist Vratislav Nov&aacute;k, the metronome is a steady reminder of the city's communist history.</p>
              <p>The vantage point also offers spectacular views over the Vltava river, and the surrounding grounds offer a beer garden and prime picnic spots with a view.</p>
              <hr />
              <h4>3. Coffee and cake at&nbsp;Kavarna Novy Svet</h4>
              <p>It's time for a coffee, and where better than in the cobblestone backstreets behind Prague Castle?</p>
              <p>This family run cafe serves up premium coffee, light bites and delicious homemade Czech baked goods. Try to nab a seat on the balcony, which is surrounded by greenery and the sounds of a nearby stream.</p>
              <hr />
              <h4>4. Look up at&nbsp;Strahov Library</h4>
              <p>Within the walls of the Strahov monastery is one of the most stunning libraries you'll ever step into.</p>
              <p>Gilded frames, frescoed ceilings and the intoxicating smell of well-worn books await in Czechia's largest monastic library.</p>
              <p>Take a pause in the lobby at the Cabinet of Curiosities, a collection of 18th century natural artefacts from a whole manner of ocean creatures, collected by sailors who initially presented them as sea monsters to the public.</p>
              <hr />
              <h4>5. Feel like a royal at Prague Castle</h4>
              <p>Wander through the largest ancient castle in the world.</p>
              <p>Founded in the 9th century and covering over 70,000 square metres (750,000 square feet), the castle complex showcases a wide range of architectural styles, including Gothic and Romanesque.</p>
              <p>Prague Castle has long been a seat for people of power, from the kings of Bohemia, to Roman emperors, and today, as the official office of the president of the Czech republic.<br />Explore the grand churches, halls and gardens, and stop into the National Gallery to delve into Bohemian art and history.</p>
              <p>If you're visiting in August, try to get tickets for the Summer Shakespeare Festival, the biggest open-air festival in Europe presenting works by William Shakespeare.</p>
              <hr />
              <h4>6. Linger at the Lennon Wall</h4>
              <p>A neighbourhood wall covered in Beatles lyrics and ideas of love and peace.</p>
              <p>For over three decades, this wall down a side street in old Prague has been a moving monument to Britain's most famous quartet, but particularly to John Lennon.</p>
              <p>A portrait of the musician once took centre stage on the wall, but is now covered up by many years of graffiti.</p>
              <p>Despite this, the spirit of the Lennon Wall remains, with hopeful wishes and lyrics from the Beatles' collection of songs being continuously layered and constantly changing the meaning of the wall.</p>
              <hr />
              <h4>7. Count the statues on Charles Bridge</h4>
              <p>Built to connect Prague Castle to Old Town, the bridge is a destination in itself.</p>
              <p>Flanking the walkway of the Charles Bridge is a collection of 30 statues, depicting numerous saints who were venerated at the time of their design.</p>
              <p>The personalities depicted on the bridge include St. Ivo, patron saint of lawyers, a statue that was commissioned by the law faculty of Charles University, and the statue of St Wenceslaus, patron saint of the Czech state.</p>
              <p>While the statues that stand today are all replicas (the originals from the 17th and 18th centuries are housed in the National Museum), it remains an intriguing look into the city's history.</p>
              <hr />
              <h4>8. Dinner at Kantyna</h4>
              <p>A butcher's shop and restaurant in one.</p>
              <p>The cooking team here at Kantyna are from another stand-out Prague restaurant Čestr. When the store was forced to closed due to renovations of the State Opera building, the owners decided to pop-up here, and add a butcher shop to their offering.</p>
              <p>The partnership was a match made in heaven, as the menu at Čestr has always been about championing local Czech produced meat and a nose-to-tail cooking approach.</p>
              <p>There are no bookings available, but be quick on your feet and nab a table as soon as one's free. Settle in and be rewarded with a delicious and authentic example of local cooking that celebrates the Czech love of meat and beer.</p>
              <hr />
              <h4>9. Drinks at Cash Only</h4>
              <p>There's more to this bar than meets the eye.</p>
              <p>When you enter Cash Only, walk past the long bar on your right and head downstairs &ndash; it's much cosier in the curved-ceiling bunker down here.</p>
              <p>The bartenders will soon serve you a delicious menu of varying cocktails, including one that comes in a birdcage.</p>
              <p>If you're still feeling a little peckish after dinner, don't worry, they've got that covered too. Grab a bucket of popcorn or order up a hot dog with your choice of toppings.</p>
              <p>When it's time to pay the bill, it's all in the name &ndash; make sure there are a few <em>koruna</em> in your wallet as cards aren't accepted.</p>
              <h3>Hemingway Bar</h3>
              <p>Sister bar to Cash Only, here the order of the day is absinthe, and lots of it.</p>
              <p>Inspired by author Ernest Hemingway, the bar has taken the writer's penchant for liquor and good times and turned it into a physical space.</p>
